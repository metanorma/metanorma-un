== Functionality

This gem processes https://www.metanorma.com/[Metanorma documents] following
a template for generating UN International Standards.

The gem currently inherits from the https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc[Metanorma-Standoc]
gem, and aligns closely to it. Refer to the ISO gem documentation
for guidance, including https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/wiki/Guidance-for-authoring[the Authoring Guide].

The following outputs are generated.

* an XML representation of the document, intended as a document model for UN
International Standards.
* The XML representation is processed in turn to generate the following outputs
as end deliverable UN standard drafts.
** HTML
** Word

NOTE: http://asciimath.org[AsciiMathML] is to be used for mathematical formatting.
The gem uses the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciimath[Ruby AsciiMath parser],
which is syntactically stricter than the common MathJax processor;
if you do not get expected results, try bracketing terms your in AsciiMathML
expressions.

== Usage

The preferred way to invoke this gem is via the `metanorma` script:

[source,console]
----
$ metanorma --type un a.adoc                   # output HTML and PDF
$ metanorma --type un --extensions html a.adoc # output just HTML
$ metanorma --type un --extensions pdf a.adoc  # output just PDF
$ metanorma --type un --extensions xml a.adoc  # output UN Metanorma XML
----

The gem translates the document into UN Metanorma XML format, and then
validates its output against the UN Metanorma XML document model; errors are
reported to console against the XML, and are intended for users to
check that they have provided all necessary components of the
document.

The gem then converts the XML into HTML and PDF.

////
The gem can also be invoked directly within asciidoctor, though this is deprecated:

[source,console]
----
$ asciidoctor -b un -r 'metanorma-un' a.adoc
----
////

== Installation

=== Quick start

https://www.metanorma.com/overview/getting-started/

=== macOS

If you are using macOS, the https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-macos-setup
repository has instructions on setting up your machine to run Metanorma
scripts such as this one. You need only run the following in a Terminal console:

[source,console]
----
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metanorma/metanorma-macos-setup/master/metanorma-setup)
$ gem install metanorma-un
$ gem install metanorma-cli
----

=== Testing

Since this software is still in development it is not yet as mature as the other standards we support. We plan to fully complete support if there is interest.

The easiest way to try out is using a Mac. It takes a little bit more work on a Windows machine through the platform-independent Docker container (see the https://www.metanorma.com/overview/getting-started/#docker-setup[Metanorma Quickstart guide]) , but it is doable.

The current examples of UN documents encoded using Metanorma is provided in https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-un

(Please run the 2-line macOS setup script prior to the following)

First, use Git to clone the code and documents:

[source,console]
--
git clone https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-un/
--

Then, install all dependencies with this command:

[source,console]
--
bundle
--

Next, run the compilation toolchain:

[source,console]
--
make all
--

Then you will see the files generated, including HTML and Word Doc. 
 
The easiest way to start a new document is to copy one of the two samples and modify them.

== Documentation

See https://www.metanorma.com/author/un/[The UN flavor of Metanorma]


== Data Models

The UN Standard Document format is an instance of the
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-model-standoc[StandardDocument model]. Details of
this general model can be found on its page.

Details of the UN modifications to this general model can be found in the
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-model-un[UN model]
repository.

== Examples

* Example documents are avalable at the https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-un[mn-samples-un] repository.

////
* Document templates are available at the https://github.com/metanorma/mn-templates-un[mn-templates-un] repository.
